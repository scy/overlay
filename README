SCYTALE’S PORTAGE OVERLAY
=========================

These are my personal additions and corrections to the official Gentoo Portage 
tree. There are three possible reasons why an Ebuild may end up here: Because 
the package is not (yet) in Portage, or in an obsolete version, or the package 
in Portage sucks.

New packages will be submitted to Sunrise as well, so you might as well get them 
there. If you are afraid of taking software from someone you don’t know, use 
Sunrise, not this overlay.


Contents
--------

dev-php5/phpunit-3.4.0
   Newer than the version currently in Portage, supports process separation. Not 
   tested thoroughly. Use at your own risk.

net-im/irssi-xmpp-0.50
   An irssi plugin (not a script) that allows you to use XMPP (Jabber) natively 
   in irssi. Works pretty well, but not yet submitted to sunrise, since testing 
   is not finished yet.

x11-apps/xdm-1.1.9-r1
   Fixes the “this is an insecure session” bug in Portage’s xdm-1.1.9, see 
   #286350. Additionally, introduces an “xconsole” flag to make it possible to 
   disable the, imho useless, xconsole at startup.

x11-misc/fmenu-0.1
   A fork of x11-misc/dmenu with more features. Is in sunrise, see #287493.

x11-misc/fmenu-9999
   The Git-sources Ebuild for fmenu. Not as tested as the 0.1 version, but has 
   more features, see <http://github.com/scy/fmenu/blob/master/CHANGES>.


Ex-Contents
-----------

www-client/uzbl-9999
   A Unix-philosophy based browser. I was using it for a week or two, but it’s 
   just not ready yet. See #270995 for probably more up-to-date ebuilds. The one 
   that has been in my overlay is attachment 205791 added 2009-10-01 22:24.


How to use it
-------------

Install Gentoo’s overlay manager, layman. Make sure you include Git support 
(i.e. USE=git). Then, add my overlay like this:

  sed -i -e \
   's#^overlays *:.*#\0\n            http://scytale.name/proj/overlay.xml#' \
   /etc/layman/layman.cfg
   # That is, add „http://scytale.name/proj/overlay.xml“ to the „overlays“
   # setting in /etc/layman/layman.cfg. Do that manually if it doesn’t work.
  layman -a scy     # Clone my repo.

That’s it.


Support
-------

Wait, what? I thought this was open source.

Seriously now, if you need support _with_my_overlay_, not the software you 
install trough it, have a look at http://scytale.name/contact/ and ask. I 
reserve the right to ignore you if I don’t have the time to reply. I reserve the 
right to ignore and/or laugh at you if your question is stupid.
